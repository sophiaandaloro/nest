#This code doesn't actually perform any model fitting, however,
#it provides an example for using rootNEST if one wishes to use execNEST + rootNEST
#to fit a data target to find optimal model/detector parameters to match data

#See lines 70-140 of src/execNEST.cpp for more info on what each of these input arguments is doing

#Note that rootNEST must be in FIT mode (mode=1) to compare with data

#First declare ranges for each of the free parameters/
#Here, in several for-loops, using 7 parameters with set ranges
